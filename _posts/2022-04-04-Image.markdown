## **Reading Notes About Image Widget**   
The PDF as follows illustrates the mechanics of Image Widget, which is widely used in project to present photos. The Image Widget   
implements cache pool, which means it presents the resource in the cache pool if present, otherwise, it tries to load the image info.  
The loading of image is a completer that will emit the updating image info and 'set state' while it is complete, in this way, the widget   
shows the final image.
